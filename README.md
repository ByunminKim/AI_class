# Genetic Algorithm for Solving TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. The algorithm uses evolutionary techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve potential solutions over multiple generations.
